2. In your terminal, run `bundle install` to install the necessary gems.
3. Run the Tweeter by typing `run bin/run.rb`.
4. You will be invited to sign in with your username, create an account, or exit. You can use the up and down arrows to choose your desired action, then press enter once it is highlighted.
5. Once you are signed in, you have the follwing options: tweets, follows, topics, logout, and exit.
6. If you choose Tweets, you are given more options. You can create a new tweet, see all your tweets, see all tweets for a topic that you will choose, update an older tweet, delete a tweet or exit.

## Final Steps
* Prepare a demo video describing how a user would interact with your working project.
    * The video should:
      * Have an overview of your project.(2 minutes max)
* Prepare a presentation to follow your video.(3 minutes max)      
    * Your presentation should:  
      * Describe something you struggled to build, and show us how you ultimately implemented it in your code.  
      * Discuss 3 things you learned in the process of working on this project.
      * Address, if anything, what you would change or add to what you have today?
      * Present any code you would like to highlight.
* OPTIONAL, BUT RECOMMENDED: Write a blog post about the project and process.
